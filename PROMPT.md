study specs/export-worker-thread-plan.md - IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN

use electron-qa-debug agent to debug and verify the changes are working as expected

IMPORTANT:
- update the implementation plan when the task is done
- author property based tests or unit tests (which ever is best)
- after making the changes to the files run tests
- set status to DONE in the implementation plan everything is finished (STATUS: DONE)
- only use STATUS: DONE once at the end of the plan when the entire plan is marked as completed
